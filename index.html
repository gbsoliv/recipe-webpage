                    <h2>Preparation Instructions</h2>
                    <p>
                        In a blender, blend the water, instant coffee, eggs, oil, sugar, and cocoa powder until smooth. 
                        Transfer the mixture to a bowl, add the flour and baking powder, and mix with a spoon. 
                        Pour the batter into cupcake liners placed inside a large muffin tray, arranging them side by side.
                        Bake in a preheated medium oven (350°F/180°C) for 25 minutes or until baked and golden. Remove from the oven and let cool.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For the filling, combine all the ingredients in a saucepan over medium heat, stirring constantly until thickened. 
                        Remove from the heat, let cool, and transfer to a piping bag fitted with a round tip. Set aside. 
                        Place the Chantilly cream into another piping bag fitted with a star tip and set aside.
                    </p>
                    <p>To assemble, make a hole in the center of each cupcake and fill it with the reserved coffee brigadeiro filling. 
                        Decorate the tops of the cupcakes with the reserved Chantilly cream, piping in circular motions. 
                        Garnish with coffee beans and refrigerate until ready to serve.
